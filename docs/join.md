The TKAI Lab is seeking highly-motivated Ph.D. students to conduct multidisciplinary research on the problems such as:

- Encoding knowledge graph with Artificial neural network to construct safe, robust Artificial general intelligence system (AGI) that can be deployed to work on high-risk domains such as medicine, finance. This field is also known as neuro-symbolic AI, where goal is to build trustworthy AI system by encoding interpretable knowledge
- Design mathematical foundation and derive theoretical limits for these models to work in polynomial time
- Design predictive coding inspired architectures for sequential modeling, encode multi-modality signals into the systems and evaluate them on critical or high-risk domains
- Design computational models that can encode various fairness metrics while learning, such that model has a prior and produces fair information by design
- Design computational models that are capable of generating and recognizing languages when trained on low-resource datasets (low resource NLP)
- Most importantly we are working on encoding knowledge and build neural architectures that are explainable (XAI) by design and also by visualization.

## PhD Students

Position Requirements: Master’s/Bachelor’s degree in majors/fields including but not limited to: Mathematics, Applied Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science/Engineering, linguistics and other related fields.

Preferred Experience: experimental research experience such as, but not limited to Fluency in at least one programming language C/C++ or python, Good working knowledge about Artificial intelligence and Reinforcement learning, Linguistics, formal language theory etc.

## Undergraduate Students

Please refer to instructions highlighted above:
- Interested in working on relevant topics highlighted in our lab’s webpage
- Self-motivated and eager to explore challenging problems in NLP and AI.
- Ideally have some background in AI/NLP and working knowledge of linear algebra and statistics

### How to work with me?

- Ideally you will/should consider starting as an volunteer and work with me for some-time. In future there with possibility of funding based on performance. Please remember evaluation is based on research conducted in any given semester and not on line of codes you have written.
- When you volunteer, I would expect you to work for minimal 5-10 hours, however given your obligations are minimal, one can adjust involvement based on schedule and current learning curve.
- Second approach is to take course credits or independent study and formally work on some challenging problems.

Instructions for Graduate Students seeking me as an advisor:
- Graduate students should satisfy requirements highlighted in the main and under the undergraduate student section.
- Graduate students are required to add additional hours and work on thesis and/or research article with me.

If you wish to work with me, then your email should have following points

- What: What are the problems you wish to explore and how it aligns with our lab’s agenda/interest.
- How: How your knowledge/experience would be beneficial for the group.
- Most important thing to remember is I can guide you, but I won’t be doing entire job for you.

If you satisfy all criteria and wish to work on challenging topics
Please send me an email(remember to mention topic) with your CV and other relevant details.
Interested in working on NLP but do not have prior experience.

At TKAI we believe each student is special and offer different perspectives for solving any given problem.

If student invest time in understanding my work, allocates time to understand NLP and then decides to approach me with interests, then exceptions can be made.

## Things not to do

- Asking me about funding without even working with me or taking my courses.
- Not looking at my papers and website, and sending me an email your work is great in AI/NLP/CV and I wish to solve everything. Such emails won’t be answered. This clearly shows you did not invest any time in reading my work/papers.
