## Principal Investigator

Dr. Ankur Mali completed his Ph.D. under Prof. Clyde Lee Giles from The Pennsylvania State University in 2022. He works at the intersection of language, memory, and computationâ€”spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP), linguistics, and formal language theory. Furthermore, he has also designed approaches to investigate the mysterious success of deep learning in recognizing natural language from a theoretical and empirical perspective. He also works on designing learning algorithms and computational neural architectures guided by theories of the brain. These architectures focus on solving challenges such as continual/lifelong learning, learning with minimal supervision, Reinforcement Learning, and robustness (both in computer vision and natural language processing).
