## Principal Investigator

![Mali](assets/images/ankur_mali.jpg){ align=left width="400" }

Dr. Ankur Mali completed his Ph.D. under Prof. Clyde Lee Giles from The
Pennsylvania State University in 2022. He works at the intersection of
language, memory, and computationâ€”spanning Natural Language Processing (NLP),
linguistics, and formal language theory. Furthermore, he has also designed
approaches to investigate the mysterious success of deep learning in
recognizing natural language from a theoretical and empirical perspective. He
also works on designing learning algorithms and computational neural
architectures guided by theories of the brain. These architectures focus on
solving challenges such as continual/lifelong learning, learning with minimal
supervision, Reinforcement Learning, and robustness (both in computer vision
and natural language processing).
