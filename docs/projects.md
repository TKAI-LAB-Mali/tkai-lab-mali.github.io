# Projects
At TKAI lab we are trying to create a stable systems for Artificial Intelligence applications. The means for this are derived from neuroscience, control theory, higher order physics, formal methods and cognitive science.
We establish theoritical as well as empirical methods to support stability approaches. 
We are trying to build systems that require minimum supervision and that use less data. Our aim is to make them computationally plausible and most importantly explanable and trust worthy.

### Continual Learning
### Alternative of Backpropagation
### Predictive Coding

## Formal Methods
